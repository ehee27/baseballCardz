// STATS GAMES and CONTEXT
// CONTEXT 1. Initialize Context Object, 2. Initialize Provider, 3. WRAP Children w Provider and value

Our Context Component 'GamesState' does 2 main things:

1. Tracks inputted game stats so we can calculate stats
2. Pulls stored stats from DB so we can render in 'Stats' component

\*\*\* how can we keep these two going when LS is cleared? It's fine when a player is starting out but they need to come back and have all their games played, it can't start at an empty array.
